Doodads:

 these are good and bad things that float around the screen.
 
 name <- identifies the type of object
 xpos <- set this value to an absolute position if you wish to add in the middle of a level. These may not intersect with bricks. If value set to -1 then they spawn
         automatically
 ypos <- set this value to an absolute position if you wish to add in the middle of a level. These may not intersect with bricks. If value set to -1 then they spawn
         automatically
 
 frequency <- if xpos/ypos is negative then this determines the rate that the objects propegate.. low,medium,high,insane
  
   ** Idea.. create an aeomeba object that blobs around and eventually replicates.. Create a single level that is a non-breakable box with a bottom entrance. Put
      a couple aeomeba in the center and set their frequency to insane.. every second or two they should split and double. This will prevent the ball
      from hitting many bricks inside. The goal is to get the ball (or something) to fend them off or wait until you get lucky to kill the few
      breakable bricks.
 
  ballspeed <- option to determine what happens to ball speed. Most basic object types will have this preset, however users can modify to create interesting effects ;-)
  
  killball  <- option to determine what happens to ball when hit. Most basic object types will have this preset, however users can modify to create interesting effects ;-)
  
  ballstatus <- not sure.. ask j3ff
